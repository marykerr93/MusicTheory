                <p class="subtitle">These are the very basics of music and of music theory. Each lesson will focus on these foundational aspects of music theory.</p>
                <p class="subtitle">You can think of each topic as a building block for the foundation of knowledge.</p>
                <p class="subtitle">All of the lessons on this website will be based in Western-style music (the same style that most popular music uses today!).</p>

                        <li> Scales: any set of notes ordered by pitch.
                            <p>There are many different types of scales; each of which can be used to set different moods to the music. Our lessons will primarily focus on Major and Minor scales.</p>

                        <li>Chords: typically 3 or more notes played simultaneously.
                            <p>Western-style music typically uses 3-note chords called triads. We will focus on these and 7th chords (chords with 4 notes)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Key Signatures: Indicate the key of a song using flats or sharps.</li>
